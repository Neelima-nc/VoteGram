## Intended Platform
- **Platform**: Android

## Intended Framework/Programming Language
- **Framework/Programming Language**: Kotlin

## Cross-Platform Development
- I prefer to focus on **native development** for Android, and I do not intend to explore cross-platform development for this project.

## Explanation for Selections
-I have chosen Android as the platform because
As an Android user, I am familiar with the interface and user experience, which will be a plus point when designing and testing the app.
As an active Android user, I have more experience on what an Android user would expect and how Android apps generally function.

-I have chosen Kotlin because
Kotlin is the preferred language for Android development, offering full compatibility with Android's APIs and libraries.
Learning Kotlin would be comparatively easier as I have worked on Java and C#.
My experience in SQL will be helpful in learning and usage of SQLite and other mobile databases like Room.
Android Studio would be the preferred IDE as it provides a great range of tools for design, testing, and debugging, and has solid documentation.

-I have chosen native development because
 I prefer to explore and specialize in native development to better understand Android-specific tools and optimizations.
Android has a larger audience and the open-source nature of Android allows for more flexibility, and we can distribute the app via multiple app stores beyond just Google Play.

-I would like to explore cross-platform development in the future.
